# Polling System (Java GUI Application)

Polling System is a Java application that has significant GUI and database properties that establish the software requirements for this project. Feedback forms or college elections are one of the examples of small-scale voting procedures that this project is intended for.

This software gives voters and poll workers a quick and easy method to get involved in the voting process. Through this application, people can cast their votes for the pre-existing alternatives. With the ability to access all voter details in one place, the administrator's job of assessing the votes is made easier.

A prerequisite is that the MySQL connection be stored in the project's root directory or, if using Intellij IDEA, added as an external library.
