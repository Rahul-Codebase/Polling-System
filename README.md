# Java GUI Application for Polling Systems

This project's software needs are determined by the Online Polling System, a Java application with significant GUI and database properties. This project is intended for feedback forms or small-scale voting procedures like college elections.

This program offers administrators and voters a quick and easy way to get involved in the polling process. Voters can select from the options that are already available in this application. When assessing the votes, the administrator's job is made easier by the ability to display all of the voter details in one convenient format.

Prerequisite: The MySQL connector needs to be stored in the project's root directory or, if using Intellij IDEA, installed as an external library.
